# **Unplugged in a Concrete Jungle**
<br>
<br>

It was a normal day, mostly raining.
When I woke up that morning, the sky was already pouring like it had something to prove. And all I could think about was how I'd drag myself through this weather to the bus stop.
<br>
<br>
I’ve never really been a fan of the rains.
<br>
<br>
Sure, from a distance, from behind glass windows with a warm drink in hand, it's poetic. But outside? When you're alone, navigating broken footpaths and uneven roads covered in a revolting blend of mud, gravel, wrappers, and something unnameable, it’s a different story.
<br>
<br>
That mess clings to the bottom of your jeans like regret.
And still, I had to leave. Office wouldn’t wait.
<br>
<br>
So I folded up the reluctant part of me, got into an auto-rickshaw, and headed for the bus stop.
<br>
<br>
Somewhere between raindrops tapping on the rickshaw roof and the slight nausea of a bump-ridden road, I found solace, in my earbuds.
<br>
<br>
I was devouring the essence of a rainy morning with a playlist that knew me well, mostly old Hindi songs from the ’90s, perfectly stitched together.
<br>
<br>
I boarded the bus, luck tilted in my favor just enough to grant me a window seat. And just like that, the rain wasn’t so bad anymore.
<br>
<br>
Now that I was on the other side of the glass, shielded from the splash and sludge, I could finally afford to romanticize it. The world outside blurred into slow motion as the bus sped through rain-soaked roads. It was the kind of view poets get obsessed with, and for a moment, I understood why.
<br>
<br>
My umbrella, soaked and sulking, rested under the seat. I’d propped it up just right, so the water could drain without making a mess. One less thing to worry about.
<br>
<br>
Despite the childlike joy of watching raindrops race down the window, a more grown-up anxiety simmered quietly: I was going to be late.
The usual suspects were all present, clogged roads, the legendary Newtown traffic, and my own sheer luck. The odds of reaching office before 10 a.m.? Let’s just say I wasn’t betting on it.
<br>
<br>
But instead of stewing in stress, I surrendered to the moment. The journey was long, the view was oddly calming and doing anything other than taking a nap would've been an injustice.
<br>
<br>
I drifted off, dreaming of a road trip with my imaginary wife, just the two of us, escaping the world with nothing but open roads ahead and good music playing.
It was warm, surreal, and achingly peaceful.
<br>
<br>
What I didn’t know was that, somewhere between one bump and another, something very real had slipped away from me.
<br>
<br>
10:05 AM.
<br>
<br>
The bus finally came to a halt, right across the gate of my office campus. The sky, perhaps out of pity, had stopped it's heavy downpour, leaving behind just a gentle drizzle and wet air that clung to the skin.
<br>
<br>
My 90s' Bollywood playlist was still playing, faithfully keeping my spirits from collapsing entirely. Everything felt manageable, mildly annoying, maybe, but not unbearable.
<br>
<br>
Until it wasn’t.
<br>
<br>
I reached into the side pocket of my backpack to grab my earbuds' case - a small, habitual motion I'd done a hundred times without thinking. But this time, my fingers met nothing but air.
<br>
<br>
A flicker of panic. I checked the other pocket. Then the main chain. Then every goddamn compartment.
<br>
<br>
The music was still playing in my ears, loud enough to drown out the city's chaos. But in that moment, everything around me faded to silence.
<br>
<br>
And I just froze.
<br>
<br>
The case was gone.
<br>
<br>
Not misplaced. Not buried somewhere under a tangle of cables or lunch wrappers. Just…gone.
<br>
<br>
The truth hit me with the subtlety of a slap, somewhere between a nap and a dream, I had lost it.
<br>
<br>
My earbuds. My shield. My safe space in this loud, exhausting world.
<br>
<br>
Gone.
<br>
<br>
I was standing in front of a chai shop, letting the drizzle tap softly against my face. No matter how bad a day begins, there are still some rituals I'll never let go of and one of them is starting the day with a cup of chai and a cigarette. Especially when I just had such a wonderful experience to start my day with !
<br>
<br>
The warmth of that first sip… it hit different. Like a quiet embrace from someone who knows your silence too well, like a hug from the woman you love after a long, lost battle. Familiar. Soothing. Unasked for, yet perfectly timed.
<br>
<br>
The smoke from my cigarette curled upward, weaving its way through the grey air, dragging my despair along with it like a slow exhale of everything unspoken. I checked my phone, the app still showed both earbuds connected. 20% battery left. Just 20%. A countdown, and I knew it. Our time together was coming to an end.
<br>
<br>
By the time I entered the office and got swallowed by the usual monotony, I was constantly checking that tiny battery percentage, like watching the final grains fall through an hourglass. And then, sometime around 11, quietly, without drama, both earbuds went cold. Silent. Gone.
<br>
<br>
That’s when the real story began.
<br>
<br>
I took off my earbuds, and instantly, the world flooded in.
<br>
<br>
The soundscape was brutal. The clacking of keyboards, murmurs of meetings, the occasional laughter echoing from a corner where people huddled together in inside jokes. It wasn’t just noise, it was a reminder, that without my music, without my personal filter, I was suddenly exposed to everything. The hollow chatter. The weight of stories whispered and rumors passed. The kind you don't even need to hear in full to understand.
<br>
<br>
Corporate spaces have a particular flavor of isolation. Everyone minds their own business, yet somehow, everyone knows everyone else's. It's modern-day professionalism, polished on the surface, but impersonal and unsettling if you don’t wear the right mask. And I've never been good with masks. People like me, the overthinkers, the misfits, the not-so-smooth-talking breed, we don’t blend in well. We just orbit the edges.
<br>
<br>
Still, I tried to shake off the noise and refocus on the mountain of pending tasks. Around 11:30, I went down to the office café. It was almost empty, probably because of the rain. I ordered an espresso, strong, black, bitter, something to match the rhythm of the day.
<br>
<br>
The rain outside had escalated. It lashed the windows as if the monsoon was putting on its final show. I leaned against the glass pane, espresso in hand, watching the city dissolve in grey streaks and distorted reflections. That's when a thought crossed my mind.
<br>
<br>
The bus I'd taken to work, it wasn't a public bus. It was one of those private fleet ones, operated by a multinational transport company. Maybe…just maybe there was still hope.
<br>
<br>
Within two minutes, I had the driver's number.
<br>
<br>
I called. Explained. Told him the seat number, the item, described the case in desperate detail.
<br>
<br>
He listened patiently.
<br>
<br>
I wasn't expecting a miracle, but part of me still hoped for one.
<br>
<br>
Barely halfway through my coffee, my phone buzzed. The driver's voice came through the line.
<br>
<br>
A soft, almost apologetic "No, sir… there's nothing here."
<br>
<br>
Just like that, hope vanished with the last sip of espresso.
<br>
<br>
I came back to my desk.
<br>
<br>
The world had not paused for my loss. In fact, it had gotten louder.
<br>
<br>
Work began to pile up, swallowing my attention. One task led to another, and before I realized it, the clock showed 2 PM. Lunchtime. I walked into the café, still deserted, eerily quiet, like a space abandoned by time.
<br>
<br>
Lunch was quick, quiet. And then, back to the desk. Back to the storm of sounds.
<br>
<br>
A symphony of distractions unfolded around me.
<br>
<br>
The guy on the far right was whispering sweet nothings to his wife over the phone. A group up front burst into laughter at something I'd never know. Someone across from me was mid-sentence, maybe scolding a junior. Behind me, a lady was passionately describing her new collection of beauty products - “So that my husband notices me more,” she said, without a hint of irony. Beside me, a guy complained endlessly about his manager. At my 2 o’clock, a young woman gushed about her upcoming hill station trip.
<br>
<br>
And it didn’t stop.
<br>
<br>
Without my earbuds, I was helpless, a bystander to everyone else's chaos. Their lives, their noise, their stories, invading the quiet sanctuary I had always kept for myself.
<br>
<br>
By 4:30 PM, I couldn't take it anymore.
<br>
<br>
I stepped out for a smoke.
<br>
<br>
The sky greeted me like an old friend. That greyish-blue hue, laced with silver, like a melancholic painting with a touch of hope. A light breeze danced past me, carrying the unmistakable scent of rain-soaked roads and damp earth. It was almost poetic.
<br>
<br>
Then - “Sir, do you need a credit card?”
<br>
<br>
A sharp, unwelcome voice broke into my reverie.
<br>
<br>
Usually, I'd smile politely and keep walking, thanks to my earbuds. But not today. Today, I had to live every awkward interaction, every street-level absurdity in its full, unfiltered glory.
<br>
<br>
And so I stood there, devouring the world’s noise, one unsolicited sentence at a time.
<br>
<br>
Whether it's as "exciting" as a random girl going with the boyfriend of her best friend or as dull as three guys discussing about how their team has build a client management system with some cutting edge technology or it can be as neutral as a lady in her mid 30s' asking her husband whether he'll come to pick her up from the office or not.
<br>
<br>
All of it, around me. Through me. Against my will.
<br>
<br>
With a cigarette in hand, drizzle on my shoulder, and a smirk that couldn't decide if it belonged to a man amused or defeated, I realized something.
<br>
<br>
I was probably having one of the weirdest, most unfiltered, and bizarrely poetic office days of my life.
<br>
<br>
Whatever this is I was experiencing, It continued till 6 PM until I decided to take my leave for the day.
<br>
<br>
I finally packed up my belongings, pushed my chair back, and walked out of the building. It was still raining.
<br>
<br>
The campus, soaked and shimmering, looked almost magical. Streetlights scattered across the wet pavement like stardust. Raindrops collected on car rooftops, glistening like scattered diamonds under the dim glow.
<br>
<br>
My earbuds might've been gone, lost to the morning rush, but the wind? The wind had never left my side.
<br>
<br>
After a few quiet minutes, I boarded the shuttle.
<br>
<br>
The journey home wasn't going to be quick, not with the evening traffic and the shuttle's mechanical wheeze filling the air between stops. Slowly, the shuttle began to crowd. Familiar faces. Unfamiliar stories.
<br>
<br>
People exchanged tales of the day, some to seatmates, others over phone calls. One guy muttered updates to his manager over a Teams call. Another, animatedly recapped office drama to someone on the other end of the line. Nothing I hadn’t seen before.
<br>
<br>
But that day… everything felt louder. The mundane felt monstrous.
<br>
<br>
I checked the time. An hour had passed.
<br>
<br>
A smirk curled at the corner of my lips.
<br>
<br>
Time to mute the world, not with earbuds this time, but with paper. With words.
I pulled out The Setting Sun by Osamu Dazai, the kind of book that doesn’t just whisper stories, but swallows you whole.
<br>
<br>
Somewhere between paragraphs, I drifted into sleep.
<br>
<br>
When I opened my eyes, the shuttle was nearly empty. My stop was 20 minutes away.
<br>
<br>
And then it hit me:
No matter how deafening the noise is, if you learn to survive within it, not fight it, not fear it, just move through it, it starts to feel less unbearable.
Maybe even human.
That goes for life too, doesn't it?
<br>
<br>
So I sat still for those last 20 minutes. No thoughts, no rush. Just…there.
<br>
<br>
The shuttle halted.
<br>
<br>
I climbed down and began walking home.
<br>
<br>
Each step splashed against rainwater-filled potholes, little craters of chaos left behind by careless engineering. Even that felt loud.
<br>
<br>
But so did everything else.
<br>
<br>
I noticed the building next door had been freshly painted.
A jewelry shop ad fluttered near the train station.
A man passed by with a face heavy with something unsaid.
I counted at least 15 dogs on the way, maybe more, maybe less.
Someone had cut down an old tree inside their yard.
And the boys playing carrom at the local club? Still getting too excited over every shot.
<br>
<br>
I wasn't looking for any of this. But I saw it all. I felt it all.
The string of noticing the ordinary, the dull, the passing, the background noise, had continued all the way home.
<br>
<br>
And just like that, I was standing at my doorstep.
<br>
<br>
Some days don’t demand answers, they just want to be felt.
And maybe, amidst the chaos, that's enough.
